# FileAction
This little java library is a utily API for searching all files recursive from a directory. Files matching to a pattern, are given to a handler you can programm.
# Build
All is as usually handled with a Makefile. Just type 'make' or 'make all', and after proceeding, you get at the working directory the output file Fileaction.jar.
# docs
Run 'make docs' to generate the javadocs of this API in the directory 'docs'.
# Using the API
For using the API, you must first build the library. After that, you must implement a class implementing the FileAction interface. To compile, you must have the jar file in your compiler search path.
